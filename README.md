# Segment Tree Project

## Introduction
This project implements a segment tree, a powerful data structure used to store information about intervals or segments. This allows for efficient range queries and updates, which are essential for many computational problems.

## Description

### Segment Trees
A segment tree is a binary tree used for storing intervals or segments. It allows querying which segments contain a certain point efficiently. It is particularly useful for answering range queries such as the sum, minimum, or maximum over a range in logarithmic time.

### Implementations
This project includes the implementation of segment trees in two forms:
- **Tree Structure:** Using tree nodes to represent segments.
- **Array Structure:** Using arrays to simulate the segment tree.

## Features
- **Range Sum Queries:** Quickly compute the sum of elements in a range.
- **Range Minimum Queries:** Quickly find the minimum element in a range.
- **Range Maximum Queries:** Quickly find the maximum element in a range.
- **Range Updates:** Efficiently update elements and propagate changes.

## Classes

### SegmentTree
- **SegmentTreeByTree:** Abstract class for segment tree using tree nodes.
- **SegmentTreeByArray:** Abstract class for segment tree using arrays.

### Nodes
- **TreeNode:** Abstract class representing a node in a binary tree.
- **SegmentTreeNode:** Extends TreeNode for segment tree nodes.

### Segment Tree Implementations
- **MaximumSegmentTreeByTree:** Implementation for maximum queries using tree nodes.
- **MinimumSegmentTreeByTree:** Implementation for minimum queries using tree nodes.
- **SummationSegmentTreeByTree:** Implementation for sum queries using tree nodes.
- **MaximumSegmentTreeByArray:** Implementation for maximum queries using arrays.
- **MinimumSegmentTreeByArray:** Implementation for minimum queries using arrays.
- **SummationSegmentTreeByArray:** Implementation for sum queries using arrays.

### Number Analyzer
- **NumberAnalyzer:** Abstract class for analyzing collections of integers.
- **NumberAnalyzerByArrays:** Implementation using arrays.
- **NumberAnalyzerByTrees:** Implementation using trees.

### Tester
- **Tester:** Class containing tests for all the public methods. Ensures that there are at least 50 test cases covering a wide range of scenarios.

## Usage

### Building the Segment Tree
To build a segment tree, you need an array of integers. Depending on the type of query (sum, minimum, maximum), use the appropriate class to construct the segment tree.

### Querying the Segment Tree
To query the segment tree for a range, use the `queryRange` method provided by the specific implementation class. This method will return the result of the query (sum, minimum, or maximum) for the given range.

### Updating the Segment Tree
To update an element in the segment tree, use the `update` method. This method will modify the element and update all relevant nodes in the tree to reflect the change.

### Example
Here's an example of how to use the segment tree for sum queries:
```java
int[] data = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11};
SummationSegmentTreeByArray segmentTree = new SummationSegmentTreeByArray(data);

// Query the sum of elements from index 1 to 3
int sum = segmentTree.queryRange(1, 3);
System.out.println("Sum from index 1 to 3: " + sum); // Output: 15

// Update the element at index 2 to 10
segmentTree.update(2, 10);

// Query the sum again from index 1 to 3
sum = segmentTree.queryRange(1, 3);
System.out.println("Sum from index 1 to 3 after update: " + sum); // Output: 20
```

### Testing
Run the `Tester` class to execute all the tests. Ensure that all tests pass to verify the correctness and robustness of the implementations
